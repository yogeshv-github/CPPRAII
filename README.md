# CPPRAII
Project to demonstrate Resource Acquisition Is Initialization on C++03 and C++17

1. RAIIDeepCopyCpp03: Deep copy implementation using raw pointers for resources.
2. RAIIDeepCopyCpp17: Deep copy implementation using unique pointers for resources.
3. RAIISharedResourceCpp17: Shallow copy implementation using shared pointer to a vector for resources.
4. RAIIUnitTests: Unit tests to test the above.
5. RAIIDemo: Main function to call unit tests.
